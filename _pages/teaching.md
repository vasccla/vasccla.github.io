## Student projet's supervision

1. **Application of Edmonds' Algorithm for Matching Sports Fixtures**: In the context of sports fixtures, this algorithm helps optimize match pairings by efficiently associating teams or players while respecting specific constraints, such as balancing encounters and avoiding repetitions.
2. **Development of a web tool for managing sports matches**:
This project involved creating a web tool to help determine the match schedule for the first round of a sports competition. The tool should generate this order and provide the relevant visualizations.
3. **Development of a data visualization website for massive datasets**:
This project aimed to explore and make accessible the vast amount of emails and documents revealed in the Enron scandal. By combining big data processing techniques with interactive visualization tools, the project enables users to explore complex relationships, communication patterns, and information flows within the company. The goal is to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights through an intuitive platform for analyzing a landmark corporate misconduct case.
